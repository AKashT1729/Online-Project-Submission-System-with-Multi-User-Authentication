Description:

We are developing an online platform for college students to submit their projects to their designated project guide and the Head of the Department (HoD) for approval.
The platform will feature three types of users: students, project guides, and HoDs. Each user will have their own login and registration page, accessible via mobile 
number or Gmail, with verification via OTP (One-Time Password).

Upon successful registration, students will have access to a dashboard where they can submit project details, including project name, project details, team members' 
names, students' registration numbers, and upload a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) file. The submitted projects will be reviewed by the project guide first,
followed by the HoD for final approval.

For project guides and HoDs, their dashboards will include a "View SRS" button next to each submitted project. Clicking on this button will allow them to view the 
uploaded SRS file for better evaluation and decision-making.

If a project is approved, an automatic notification will be sent to the student's registered email or mobile number. In the event of project rejection, a notification 
stating "Your project has been rejected" will be sent to the student's registered contact information.

Additionally, the platform will include a "Forgot Password" button for users to reset their password via OTP for added security and convenience.
